# Swachh Bharat - A necessity

>### ***Cleanliness is a state of purity, clarity, and precision.***

Open defecation and sewage contamination of drinking and bathing water has been an endemic sanitary problem in India. 
In 2014, India was the country with the highest number of people practicing open defecation, around 530 million people.

**Swachh Bharat Abhiyan** is started to make India a clean India by the effort of all the citizens living in the country.
It has been clearly declared by the Prime Minister, *Narendra Modi*.
One of its main objectives is to bring about an *improvement* in the general quality of life in the rural areas, by 

- promoting cleanliness, 
- improving standards of hygiene, and 
- eliminating open defecation.

Many __Educational Institutions__ have enforced Swachh Bharat Initiative, and encourage students to not only eliminate waste, but to also reduce waste production and spread awareness about the same.
